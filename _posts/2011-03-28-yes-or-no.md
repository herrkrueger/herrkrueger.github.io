From "Yes or No: The Guide to Better Decisions: A Story" by Spencer Johnson ([Affiliate Link](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/0887306314/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=herrkrue-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1638&amp;creative=19454&amp;creativeASIN=0887306314)).

One of the books, that influenced me a lot, starting two years ago... thank you again, my friend &nbsp;[Tony](http://www.guerrilla.de), for this recommendation! I got the Audio Cassette, read by the fantastic Edward Hermann and ordered the book afterwards.

The book is a simple, entertaining guide to make better private and business decisions. It's easy to listen to, the typical dialogue style of us business books but not too much motivational, brainwashy - like some of the other books, I tried hard to read in the past.

For me to remember and for You as a brutal shortcut here are the cards, that Spencer recommend to create and put&nbsp;into your wallet:
